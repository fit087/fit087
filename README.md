### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ“« I'm Adolfo. You can find me at [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adolfo-correa-lopez/)

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about I'm PhD Student at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro researching about fluid mechanics with Physically Informed Neural Networks (PINN)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm a Pre-Doctoral Research Intern at IBM and I'm looking for a reallocation into the DS, ML, DL industry.

### Working ðŸ”­
Iâ€™m currently working at IBM as intern on a C++ project/Python API using pore-network modeling applied to reduce greenhouse gas emisions with CO<sub>2</sub> capture and geological storage (CCGS, or simply CCS)

### Studying ðŸŒ±
I'm a PhD student of Mechanical Engineering at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio). I'm developing my doctoral thesis using a physically informed neural network (PINN) to solve the fluid flow of oil and gas in a oil reservoir. I also own a Master of Science diploma in Computational Mechanics.
